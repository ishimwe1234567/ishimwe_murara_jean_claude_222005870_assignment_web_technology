			<ol><li><b> JAVA PROGRAMMING</b></li>
				<p>In this chapter I will be describing how powerful generalpurpose programming language was used to create the analyzed system. Under this chapter I will undergo full detail of how everything will function together with database that have been describe above and how it cope with full analyzed system.</p>
				<p>
					<p><b>3.2 Tools used to develop this system in java programming:</b></p>
					<p><b><u>Eclipse IDE:</u></b> an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It 
contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the 
environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and, until 2016, 
was the most popular.</p>
<p> 
<b>JAR </b>stands for <b>JAVA ARCHIVE .</b> it is a file format based on the popular zip file format and is used for aggregating many files into one . although JAR  can be used as a general archiving tool , the primary motivation for its development was so that java applets and their requisite component</p>
<p><b>MySQL Connectors.</b> MySQL provides standards-based drivers for <u>JDBC</u>,<u> ODBC,</u> and 
.Net enabling developers to build database applications in their language</p>
<p>Object-Oriented: Java is fundamentally object-oriented, meaning it revolves around the concept of classes and objects. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, promoting modular, reusable, and maintainable code.</p>
 
<p>Platform-Independent: One of Java's most significant features is its platform independence. Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This "write once, run anywhere" capability makes Java highly portable across different operating systems and hardware architectures.</p>
 
<p>Robust and Secure: Java is designed with a strong emphasis on reliability and security. It incorporates features like automatic memory management through garbage collection, exception handling, and strict type checking to ensure robustness. Additionally, Java's bytecode verification process enhances security by preventing unauthorized code execution.</p>
 
<p>Multi-threaded: Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program. This feature facilitates the development of responsive and scalable applications, making Java suitable for building server-side applications, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and multimedia applications.</p>
 
<p>Rich Standard Library: Java comes with an extensive standard library (Java API) that provides ready-to-use classes and methods for various tasks. The Java API covers areas such as input/output (I/O), networking, database connectivity, graphical user interface (GUI) development, and more. This rich set of libraries simplifies development and accelerates the creation of Java applications.</p>
 
<p>Community Support and Ecosystem: Java benefits from a large and active community of developers, enthusiasts, and organizations. This vibrant ecosystem contributes to the continuous evolution of the language through updates, frameworks, libraries, and tools. Java's popularity and widespread adoption ensure ample resources, documentation, and support available for developers.</p>
 
<p>Used Across Diverse Applications: Java finds applications in a wide range of domains, including web development, enterprise software, mobile app development (Android), scientific computing, financial services, and more. Its versatility and scalability make it a popular choice for building large-scale, mission-critical systems.</p>
 
<li><b>	The Java programming environment consists of several components:</b></li>

<p>Java Development Kit (JDK): Provides tools for developing Java applications, including the Java compiler (javac), the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and various utilities.</p>

<p>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software tools that facilitate Java development by providing features such as code editing, debugging, and project management. Popular Java IDEs include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans.</p>
<p>Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Includes the JVM and libraries necessary for running Java applications. It allows users to execute Java programs without needing the development tools provided by the JDK.</p>

<p>Java Application Programming Interface (API): A collection of pre-written Java classes and interfaces organized into packages. The Java API provides a vast array of functionality for tasks such as input/output operations, networking, GUI development, and more.</p>
 
<p>JDBC, which stands for Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases. It provides a standard interface for connecting to relational databases and executing SQL queries. JDBC enables Java applications to perform database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data.</p>
   <h2><bold><li>The steps involved in establishing connectivity using JDBC typically include:</li></bold></h2>
 
   <li><b> Import JDBC Packages:</b></li>
      <p>Import the necessary JDBC packages in your Java program. These packages include java.sql and specific database driver packages.</p>
 
   <li><b> Load and Register the JDBC Driver:
      <p>Use Class.forName( ) to dynamically load and register the JDBC driver for the specific database you're connecting to. This step is necessary to inform the DriverManager about the database driver.</p>
 
   ``<P>`java
      Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");</p>
   
 
   <li><b> Create a Connection:</b></li>
      <p>Use the `DriverManager.getConnection( )` method to establish a connection to the database. You need to provide the URL of the database, username, and password.</p>
 
   ``<P>`java
   Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database", "username", "password");</p>
   
 
   <li><b>Create a Statement:</b></li>
      <p>Create a Statement or PreparedStatement object to execute SQL queries. Statements are used for executing static SQL queries, while PreparedStatements are preferred for parameterized queries.</p>
 
   ``<p>`java
   Statement statement = connection.createStatement();</p>
   
 
   <li><b> Execute SQL Queries:</b></li>
      <P>Use the Statement or PreparedStatement objects to execute SQL queries and receive results.</P>
 
   <p>java
   ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM your_table");</p>
   
 
   <li><b> Process Results:</b></li>
     <p> Process the results obtained from the executed queries.</p>
 
   <li><b> Close Resources:</b></li></ol>
      <p>Close the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects to release resources and avoid memory leaks.</p>
 
   <p>`java
   resultSet.close();
   statement.close();
   connection.close();</p>
